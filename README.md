# AD-GIF-LIBRARY
Welcome to the Autodarts sounds and GIF library. 

Here you can easily copy links of sound effects which you can insert into Autodarts tools. 

For the gifs we put together complete gif packages. You can simply use these. You only have to copy links and triggers into autodarts tools.
However, you can also create your own packages using the template. 

I am open to further suggestions regarding the addition of gifs or entire packages, as well as sounds and suggestions for improvement.
