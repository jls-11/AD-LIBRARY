# AD-GIF/FX-LIBRARY 📚
🤗 Welcome to the Autodarts sounds and GIF library. 

➡️ Here you can easily copy links of [sound effects](Sound-FX) which you can insert into Autodarts tools.

➡️ For the [gifs](gifs) we put together complete gif packages. You can simply use these. You only have to copy links and triggers into autodarts tools.

➡️ However, you can also create your own packages using the [template](gifs/template).
